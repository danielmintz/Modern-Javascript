As new to this watch others do it a few times first. Focus on their body position as they ride and approach different obstacles. Make sure you are wearing flats as whether you need to or not having the freedom to put your foot out is great.<\/p> <p align=\"left\">You will notice with beginners shore a couple of things. Firstly where the shore is narrow you are normally no more than a foot off the ground (think would you ride along the curb). Secondly where it gets higher it is normally much wider (as wide as a singletrack trail on a mountainside). The beginner shore courses are also short as this requires lots of concentration that builds up over time. In beginner's shore there is little you haven't done already out in the trails without realising it. Think riding along a painted line on the road or a not too tight rut in a trail. Focus, and enjoy<\/p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Step 2:<\/strong><\/p> <p align=\"left\">Get a moderate speed up before joining the shore section. Keep yourself in a lowish gear at all times, yet not too low that you can't control the bike with pedal force..Changing gear should be kept to the minimum if not avoided in beginners shore as you have enough to concentrate on. Have yourself at all times out of the saddle but crouched reasonably  to control your centre of gravity.<\/p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Step 3:<\/strong><\/p> <p align=\"left\">Join the shore already moving and smoothly. Keep a steady pace throughout. (Regular breathing helps). Keep your eyes a few feet ahead, not at the ground you are on (a bit like walking really). This is essential for balance. Remember it is your front wheel that directs the bike so keep a controlled pressure on the front tyre to navigate the turns.<\/p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Step 4:<\/strong><\/p> <p align=\"left\">Beginners shore often have little pyramids that go sharply up and down. As on the trail ride into the up and ensure your body weight is back for the down. They also have berms that widen out. As on the trail use your front wheel to carve the turn.  Little drops are common place. Think riding off a curve.  Body weight slightly back is normally adequate or with a little more speed a front wheel lift. This something you need to judge and why watching other do the run first a few times can be invaluable. On moderate shore then wheelie drops become the norm but unlikely yet.<\/p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Step 5:<\/strong><\/p> <p align=\"left\">Always ride with others. It's technically easier than it looks and you can do it. Get out and give it a go<\/p> <p align=\"left\">See this video below taken at Esher Shore to see where you can end up<\/p> <p align=\"left\">{youtube}kJvJPl607YU{\/youtube}<\/p> <p><em>(picture courtesy of Metalhead)<\/em><\/p>","state":"0","catid":"60","created":"2007-07-27 01:29:03","created_by":"67","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2012-08-31 15:45:49","modified_by":"926","checked_out":"0","checked_out_time":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","publish_up":"2007-07-27 00:50:57","publish_down":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","images":"","urls":"","attribs":"{\"pageclass_sfx\":\"\",\"back_button\":\"\",\"item_title\":\"1\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"introtext\":\"1\",\"section\":\"1\",\"section_link\":\"1\",\"category\":\"1\",\"category_link\":\"1\",\"rating\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"createdate\":\"\",\"modifydate\":\"\",\"pdf\":\"\",\"print\":\"\",\"email\":\"\",\"keyref\":\"\",\"docbook_type\":\"\"}","version":"17","ordering":"1","metakey":"Shore Virgins","metadesc":" Shore, originated from North America as a means of covering land that wasn't passable. it is today accessible at every level and a defined discipline that excels more than any other in pushing our balance, bike control, technique and boundaries.","access":"1","hits":"3007","metadata":"","featured":"0","language":"*","xreference":"","note":""},
